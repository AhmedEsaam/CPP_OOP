/// Reasons for Multifile Programs ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
/*
    There are several reasons for using multifile programs. These include:
        → the use of class libraries,
        → the organization of programmers working on a project, 
        → and the conceptual design of a program.
*/

/* Note: #include "theirs.h"
    Quotes rather than angle brackets around the filename tell the compiler to look for the file in
        the current directory, rather than in the default include directory
*/

/* Each compiler has its own library files...
    • Each compiler keeps its own library files (such as IOSTREAM and CONIO.H) in a particular directory, often called INCLUDE.
    • You can also tell the compiler about other include directories that you create yourself. 
        You may want to keep some of your header files in such a directory, 
        where they will be available for several projects.
*/

/* The Build Process:
    Only a single command needs to be given to the compiler to compile all the source (.CPP and .H) files 
    and link the resulting .OBJ files (and any other .OBJ or .LIB files) into a final .EXE file.
    → This is called the build process.
